Volunteer Management System

## Project Description

The **Volunteer Management System** is a Java-based console application that allows administrators to manage volunteers, organize events, assign tasks, and monitor activity logs. It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a modular, maintainable, and scalable structure.

This system is designed for non-profit organizations or community projects where volunteer coordination is essential.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Access Control**  
  Secure login for Admin users to manage system functions.

- **Logging Entry & Exit Times**  
  Tracks user login/logout activity with timestamps to maintain basic system security.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  - Register new volunteers  
  - Create and manage events  
  - Assign tasks to volunteers  
  - Add volunteers to specific events  
  - View all volunteers and events  
  - Generate system usage reports

- **Volunteer Profiles**  
  - Each volunteer has an ID, name, event history, assigned tasks, and can provide feedback.

- **Event Management**  
  Admins can create events and add volunteers as participants.

- **System Report**  
  Displays total number of volunteers, events, and system logs (login/logout).

## Technologies Used

- Java (Standard Edition)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation)
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Java Date and Time (`Date` class)
